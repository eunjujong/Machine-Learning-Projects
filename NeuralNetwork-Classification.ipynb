    "#### QUESTION: How does our multilayer perceptron model compare to our kNN model? Our linear model?\n",
    "Q1: With the training accuracy of about 94%, the multilayer perceptron model seems to learn well and its training accuracy is similar to the kNN model. But its training accuracy is slightly lower than the training accuracy of the the linear model. For the kNN model, the training score is 0.93427 and the testing score is 0.92308 for k = 28. For the linear mode, the training score is 0.977 and the testing score is 0.972 with c =197.57977. We can see that there is a larger discrepancy between the training set and the testing set for the multilayer perceptron model compared to kNN and linear. This means that there is a greater risk of overfitting in the multilayer perceptron model. \n",

    "#### QUESTION: Does allowing the MLP Classifier to run through learning iterations until it converges improve its performance? What evidence is there we might be overfitting?\n",
    "Q3: The MLP classifier begins to converge with max_iter >= 247. When the max iterations are at 200, the training accuracy is 99.5% and the testing accuracy is 96.5%. When the max iterations are at 247, the training accuracy is 99.8% and the testing accuracy is 96.5%. Only the training accuracy improved by 0.3%. On the other hand, the max iterations of 247 increased the discrepancy between the training set and the testing set by 0.003. Therefore, the risk of overfitting of the model increased as well."

    "Q4: α = 0.65 seems to produce a MLP classifier that learns and generalize well (Training accuracy = 98.8%, Test accuracy = 98.6%). The selection of α is based on the discrepancy between the training and the test sets such that the training and the test accuracy scores are as close as possible without lowering the test accuracy. What I observed is that as α increased, the training accuracy tended to decrease and the test accuracy tended to increase. As α is increased to 0.65 (or to some other larger α values that generate the same result), the complexity of the model decreased. So, the discrepancy is less and the risk of overfitting is lower. "

    "Q1: With the training accuracy of about 94%, the multilayer perceptron model seems to learn well and its training accuracy is similar to the kNN model. But its training accuracy is slightly lower than the training accuracy of the linear model. For the kNN model, the training score is 0.93427 and the testing score is 0.92308 for k = 28. For the linear model, the training score is 0.977 and the testing score is 0.972 with c =197.57977. We can see that there is a larger discrepancy between the training set and the testing set for the multilayer perceptron model compared to kNN and linear. This means that there is a greater risk of overfitting in the multilayer perceptron model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: After rescaling the data, we can see that the performance of the training set improved by 0.056 and the performance of the testing set improved by 0.049. Compared to both kNN and linear models, the multilayer perceptron model is training better. Though it is performing the prediction better than the kNN model, its prediction performance is slightly lower than the linear model. Considering the discrepancy between the training set and the testing set, it has not been reduced from rescaling the data.\n",

    "Q3: The MLP classifier begins to converge with max_iter >= 247. When the max iterations are at 200, the training accuracy is 99.5% and the testing accuracy is 96.5%. When the max iterations are at 247, the training accuracy is 99.8% and the testing accuracy is 96.5%. Only the training accuracy improved by 0.3%. On the other hand, the max iterations of 247 increased the discrepancy between the training set and the testing set by 0.003. Therefore, the risk of overfitting of the model increased as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO2: With the max_iter = 247, the MLP classifier was produced with the alpha incremented from 0.0001 to 10 by factors of 10 units. The min alpha value of 0.65 seemed to produce a classifier that learns and generalizes well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: α = 0.65 seems to produce a MLP classifier that learns and generalize well (Training accuracy = 98.8%, Test accuracy = 98.6%). The selection of α is based on the discrepancy between the training and the test sets such that the training and the test accuracy scores are as close as possible without lowering the test accuracy. What I observed is that as α increased, the training accuracy tended to decrease and the test accuracy tended to increase. As α is increased to 0.65 (or to some other larger α values that generate the same result), the complexity of the model decreased. So, the discrepancy is less and the risk of overfitting is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried to alter the size of the hidden layer from 1 to 100 and the classifier did not seem to reach the same performance level anymore. Overall, the performance seemed to increase as the size of the hidden layer got larger and the performance seemed to fluctuate a bit with smaller layer sizes. Though the performance did not exceed 0.9 and I am not sure if this is what I am supposed to get from changing the size of the hidden layer. What I do not understand is that if the max units of a hidden layer are 100, I wonder why I would not get the same performance as before when I set the size to be 100 (----> anyone has the answer to this?)."

    "With the random state of 42 and all else in the default setting, changing the activation function to logistic (activation='logistic') increased the training accuracy, but there was a concern of overfitting. With the random state of 42 and all else in the default setting, I found that the hidden layer size of 15 (hidden_layer_sizes=(15,)) generated the greatest training as well as testing accuracy among the size variation between 1-30. With the random state of 42 and all else in the default setting, increasing the initial learning rate to 0.1 (learning_rate_init= 0.01,) increase the training accuracy to 100% (I wonder if this is possible?), but the testing accuracy did not differ much. The same result as increasing the initial learning rate was generated when I changed the solver for weight optimization to lbfgs (solver='lbfgs'). With (solver='lbfgs', hidden_layer_sizes=(20,)), the training accuracy increased to 100% and the testing accuracy also increased to 97.2%."
